ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @joshiteoshi, a computing undergraduate in sutd.

Iâ€™m interested in games (of both the video and theory variety), computer parts, robotics, and never actually getting anything meaningful done. Iâ€™m also learning rust rn lmao.

I think computers are really cool and want to learn more stuff.
